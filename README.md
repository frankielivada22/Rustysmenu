How to use wifi spammer?
If you are wanting your own wordlist just copy or move it
into the wifi folder

If it doesnt work and you are getting errors after running the script
then make shure you wifi card can be put into monitor mode, if it can
make shure you are using the right interface (e.g wlan0, wlan1)

How to use Discord RaidBot?
IDK but most things in it wont work DONT ASK!!!
but to add your own tokens just put ur list into the discord folder
and name it "tokens.txt"

How to use metasploit payload creator?
just go though it its not hard.
if I can do it you can.

Most things might not work and it might break time to time, but remember
this is my fire time coding in bash I thought Id get straight into it and
just make something helpful for me so I dont have to remember heaps of commands.
